# Opinion dynamics in the Voter Model

This repository contains code for two works related to the analysis of opinion dynamics under the voter model. `util.py` contains custom functions used throughout the various notebooks.

[Proceedings of Complex Networks and Their Applications X](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-93413-2_29). Preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07265), [HAL](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02872161).

> All code is in `opinion_control.ipynb`. Folder `simu_results/` contains results of the simulations performed for the paper and used for plots.
